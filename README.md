### Hi, I'm Varun Naik ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate and dedicated undergraduate student at UC San Diego, majoring in Economics and Mathematics-Computer Science, with a minor in Finance. My interests lie at the intersection of finance, data analysis, and technology, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to leverage quantitative tools to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’¼ **Professional Experience**: I've gained hands-on experience in finance through roles as an Investment Banking Summer Analyst at Nomura and a Growth Equity Fund Analyst at University Growth Fund. My work has involved financial modeling, market research, and data-driven decision-making, equipping me with a strong foundation in both finance and analytics.

ðŸ“Š **Technical Skills**: I'm proficient in Python, R, and Java for data analysis and software development, as well as in tools like Excel, Bloomberg Terminal, and Power BI. I'm always excited to expand my skill set and explore innovative ways to analyze and visualize financial data.

ðŸš€ **What Iâ€™m Working On**: Iâ€™m currently developing projects that blend finance and technology, with a particular focus on portfolio optimization and quantitative trading strategies. Iâ€™m also actively involved in the Triton Quantitative Trading club and the Undergraduate Investment Society at UCSD, where I enjoy collaborating with like-minded peers on finance-related initiatives.
